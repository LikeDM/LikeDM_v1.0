Simply ./create_LikeDM.sh
Usage: ./pyLikeDM.py LikeDM_input_example.ini
       

NOTE1: If user wants to install pure fortran version of LikeDM, we 
       recommend to use compiler ifort because the fortran version 
       of Minuit does not work well with gfortran or others. 
       In this case, simply decompress FMinuit.tar.gz and copy 

       LikeDM/Makefile.org to LikeDM/Makefile and 
       LikeDM/src/Makefile.org to LikeDM/src/Makefile, then make.
       If ifort compiler is not available, we recommend to use 
       pyLikeDM: LikeDM with python interface.

NOTE2: To install pyLikeDM, you need "f2py" package.
       Please prepare "numpy" before installation. 
       
       - To install "f2py" with the ubuntu system:
         sudo apt-get install python-numpy
         sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

       The script create_LikeDM.sh is just an example to install
       pyminuit and pyLikeDM.
       Please modify this script by your own use.
