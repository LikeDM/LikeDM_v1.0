Simply ./create_LikeDM.sh
Usage: ./pyLikeDM.py LikeDM_input_example.ini
       

NOTE1: If user wants to install pure fortran version of LikeDM, we 
       recommend to use compiler ifort because the fortran version 
       of Minuit does not work well with gfortran or others. 
       In this case, simply decompress FMinuit.tar.gz and copy 

       LikeDM/Makefile.org to LikeDM/Makefile and 
       LikeDM/src/Makefile.org to LikeDM/src/Makefile, then make.
       If ifort compiler is not available, we recommend to use 
       pyLikeDM: LikeDM with python interface.

NOTE2: To install pyLikeDM, you need "f2py" package.
       Please prepare "numpy" before installation. 
       
       - To install "f2py" with the ubuntu system:
         sudo apt-get install python-numpy
         sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev
         
NOTE3: Add the following line in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file
       to enable the call of pyminuit library (path_LikeDM is the
       path of your LikeDM folder):
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_LikeDM/CPPMinuit/src/.libs/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       export PYTHONPATH=path_LikeDM/pyminuit/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH


       The script create_LikeDM.sh is just an example to install
       pyminuit and pyLikeDM.
       Please modify this script by your own use.
